## Installation

N/A - live on the web.

## Usage

## Credits

I have designed and developed this page myself, in order to demonstrate my abilities.  Very 'meta'!

I followed this [Professional README guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)


## License

I have used The MIT License (see repo) as it is the most widely used open source license as of this writing. 

It is a permissive license, so it doesn't have much by way of requirements.  In addition, it is well-known and facilitates re-use in other projects.

## How to Contribute

Given the nature of this page, it believe I would be misrepresenting myself if I merged someone else's code into this particular project.  This portfolio is a demonstration of my own personal competency, and it is important that all work is my own.
